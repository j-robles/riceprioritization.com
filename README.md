## üìä RICE Framework

The RICE prioritization method evaluates projects based on:

- **R**each: How many people will be affected
- **I**mpact: How much impact it will have (huge/high/mid/low/tiny)
- **C**onfidence: How confident you are in estimates (high/mid/low)
- **E**ffort: How much work it will take

**Formula**: `(Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence) / Effort`
